Harness is a modern software delivery platform helping enterprises ship code easily, quickly and
resiliently. It was last valued at \$3.7 Billion in April, 2022 and I was among the first 50
employees to join Harness.

I was part of the Continuous Delivery team and the Pipeline team building the foundations for all
the other teams (CD/CI/Feature Flags/Cloud Cost Management) to build workflow products. My main
contributions were to the design and development of the underlying workflow execution mechanism
powering all these products. I also led the transition from a monolith Java app to a polyglot
microservices deployment as the product offerings grew.
