Plato is a chat app for one-on-one career mentoring.

I co-founded the company after a pilot during college placement season and worked on the product
and tech. It was funded by Commence Mint and selected for Y Combinator Startup School. We got 2nd
position in Microsoft Imagine Cup, India (2015) and were incubated at IIT Kanpur.
