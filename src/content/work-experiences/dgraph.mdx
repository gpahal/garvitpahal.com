Dgraph is one of the most popular open source graph database in the world. It is built to be
distributed and scalable.

I was a founding engineer at Dgraph. I launched Ratel, which is Dgraph's data visualisation and
cluster management interface. I created tooling for the ecosystem - built javascript (browser and
node) and python clients for Dgraph, contributed to the other clients. I also laid groundwork for
the Dgraph-as-a-service platform built on top of Kubernetes.
