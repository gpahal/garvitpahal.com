This was a research project under Dr Sumit Gulwani (Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research,
Redmond) and Prof. Amey Karkare (Head of Computer Science and Engineering Department, IIT Kanpur).

We built an application to assist in teaching introductory programming courses in the 1st year of
college by automating assignment and feedback generation and solution-checking. The project was
deployed in the 2014-15 academic year (with 400+ enrolled students) and was used by the students to
practice programming assignments and get immediate feedback.
