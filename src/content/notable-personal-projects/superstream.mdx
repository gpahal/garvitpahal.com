[Superstream](https://superstream.finance/) is a protocol and a collection of SDKs for real-time money streaming on
Solana. It allows anyone to continuously send money to anyone else at any interval up to a second.

The motivation for this project was to help solve the earned wage access problem. Low-income workers sometimes face
cash crunch at the end of the month if there is any sudden financial expense and they have to resort to predatory
loans. Workers have to wait for the next payday which is often not aligned with their cash needs. Superstream allows
workers to get paid hourly, daily or any other cadence. People can also pay for services in smaller increments, instead
of monthly or yearly.

I designed, implemented, and deployed it on devnet, testnet and mainnet clusters of Solana. The project is
[open source](https://github.com/gpahal/superstream) and documented at
[superstream.finance](https://superstream.finance/).
